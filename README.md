Tic Tac Toe (Python3 version)
=============================

An interactive two-player tic-tac-toe game.

Usage
-----
This is a human vs. human tic-tac-toe game. Before the game starts, you will be given an option of choosing the size (dimensions) of the n x n board; type an integer number, and the board will be displayed. Each player can choose a character/symbol to use as their marker. The person who goes first is chosen randomly. The game will ask to type a cell number (whatever number displayed in the board). The rules are the same as normal tic-tac-toe: you win if any row, column, or diagonal has the same character. The game ends when there's a winner or a tie. Have fun!

Example Execution
-----------------
Two players interact with the program as shown here.
